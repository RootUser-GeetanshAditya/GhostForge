# üëª GhostForge

GhostForge is a customizable payload generation and shellcode obfuscation tool designed for red team research, adversary simulation, and malware evasion analysis. It generates XOR+Base64 encoded shellcode loaders in C, compiles them with `mingw-w64`, and optionally signs them with a fake certificate to improve delivery success.

## üöÄ Features

- Generate shellcode with `msfvenom`
- XOR+Base64 encoding to evade static detection
- C payload loader generator
- Windows PE evasion via `lief` (e.g. header obfuscation, section mangling)
- Optional fake certificate signing using `osslsigncode`
- Supports multiple platforms: Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, PHP, Python, Java

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Linux system (tested on Arch/Manjaro)
- [`msfvenom`](https://docs.metasploit.com/)
- `python3` with:
  - `lief`
- `mingw-w64-gcc` (`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`)
- `osslsigncode`
- `openssl`

### üì• Install Dependencies (Arch Linux)

```bash
# MSF and osslsigncode
sudo pacman -S metasploit osslsigncode

# Python module
pip install lief

# Cross compiler
paru -S mingw-w64-gcc
```

## üîß Usage

```bash
chmod +x ghostforge.sh
./ghostforge.sh
```

- Choose from a list of payloads or input a custom one
- Shellcode will be XOR+Base64 encoded
- A C loader will be generated and compiled to a Windows executable
- PE file will be modified with evasive techniques
- The payload will be fake-signed with a self-signed certificate

### üìÅ Output

After completion, you'll find:
```bash
legit_app.exe  # Final obfuscated and signed payload
```

Use msfconsole as the handler:
```bash
msfconsole -qx 'use exploit/multi/handler; set PAYLOAD <your-payload>; set LHOST=<your-ip>; set LPORT=<your-port>; run'
```
